## Introduction

Welcome to the `Network-Based Data Analysis` project for the QCB 2023/2024 class. In this project, we will delve into the world of molecular profiling in biliary atresia, utilizing the dataset GSE15235 obtained from a prospective observational study conducted by the Biliary Atresia Research Consortium. This study aims to explore the molecular signatures associated with inflammation and fibrosis in the livers of infants diagnosed with biliary atresia.

### Project Overview

Our analysis will focus on the following key aspects:

1. **Disease Staging Exploration:**
   - Investigating the molecular signatures that distinguish between inflammation and fibrosis at the time of diagnosis.
   - Exploring potential associations between molecular profiles and clinical outcomes.

2. **Predictive Modeling:**
   - Utilizing prediction analysis models to classify livers into inflammation or fibrosis based on gene expression profiles.
   - Validating predictions through statistical analyses, including cross-validation on each model.

3. **Clinical Associations:**
   - Investigating the relationship between molecular signatures, the [SCUDO R library](https://www.cosbi.eu/prototypes/scudo) will be used to manage this part.

## Project Sections

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

In this section, we will perform an exploratory analysis of the dataset, visualizing key features, and gaining insights into the distribution of molecular signatures.

#### Sample Visualizations:
- Boxplots depicting gene expression dataset and how is distributed.
- Distribution plots illustrating the age distribution of infants with distinct molecular signatures.

### 2. Predictive Modeling

We will employ R packages for machine learning to build and evaluate prediction models based on the unique molecular signatures identified in the study.

#### Key R Packages:
- [`caret`](https://topepo.github.io/caret/): for building and evaluating predictive models.
- [`glmnet`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html): for fitting feature selection (relaxed LASSO / Elastic net).

### 3. Clinical Associations

This section will focus on exploring the clinical relevance of molecular signatures, including their correlation with traditional markers and clinical outcomes using SCUDO.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the biliary atresia dataset, shedding light on the potential network-based interactions underlying disease progression and clinical outcomes.
