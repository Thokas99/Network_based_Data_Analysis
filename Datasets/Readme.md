# Study Summary: Molecular Profiling in Biliary Atresia

## Background
- Young age at portoenterostomy linked to improved outcomes in biliary atresia.
- Biological factors may influence disease progression.
- Objective: Determine if molecular profiling of liver identifies disease stages at diagnosis.

## Methods
- **Patient Cohort:** 47 infants with biliary atresia in a prospective observational study.
- **Data Collection:** Clinical, laboratory data, and liver biopsies at diagnosis and up to 2 years.
- **Histological Scoring:** Liver biopsies scored for inflammation and fibrosis.
- **Gene Expression Profiles:** 14 livers with inflammation/fibrosis used for unique molecular signature (150 gene probes).
- **Prediction Analysis Models:** Gene probes classified remaining livers into inflammation or fibrosis.
- **Validation:** Immunostaining and quantitative PCR for biological plausibility and clinical relevance.

## Key Findings
1. **Disease Staging at Diagnosis:** 14 livers displayed inflammation (N=9) or fibrosis (N=5).
2. **Molecular Signature:** 150 gene probes revealed unique molecular signatures.
3. **Prediction Analysis:** Probes successfully classified 29 of 33 remaining livers into inflammation or fibrosis.
4. **Validation:** Increased hepatic population of lymphocyte subsets and matrix substrates.
5. **Clinical Associations:** No associations with traditional markers, but inflammation signature linked to younger age; fibrosis linked to decreased transplant-free survival.

## Conclusion
- Molecular profiling at diagnosis uncovers inflammation or fibrosis signatures in most livers.
- Signatures may relate to staging at diagnosis, with implications for clinical outcomes.

## Study Design
- **Overall Design:** Prospective, observational study by Biliary Atresia Research Consortium.
- **Data Collection:** Clinical, laboratory data, and liver biopsies at diagnosis and every 3-6 months until 2 years.
- **Histological Scoring:** Liver biopsies scored for inflammation and fibrosis.
- **Gene Expression Profiles:** Group-specific profiles generated for inflammation and fibrosis groups.
- **Molecular Staging:** Gene expression profile used to assign molecular stages to the entire cohort.
- **Validation:** Immunostaining and quantitative PCR for biological plausibility and clinical relevance.
